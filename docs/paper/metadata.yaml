abstract: |
  Despite proven ROI, predictive maintenance adoption remains at 27% due to three barriers: expertise shortage (24-52% of manufacturers), vendor lock-in concerns (80% seek to avoid), and integration complexity with legacy systems. Existing TinyML solutions force a tradeoff between open architecture (requiring expert setup) and ease of use (with proprietary dependencies). We present TinyOL-HITL, an open-standard system combining unsupervised streaming k-means, human-in-the-loop corrections, and standard industrial protocols (MQTT/OPC-UA). The system starts with K=1 (no pre-training), growing dynamically as operators label discovered fault types. Features are extracted on-device using time-domain analysis (RMS, peak amplitude, crest factor) from 3-axis accelerometer data, providing orientation-independent fault signatures. Validated on CWRU bearing dataset and real motor test rig across ESP32 (Xtensa) and RP2040 (ARM Cortex-M33) platforms with 1.2KB memory footprint. Results show [PLACEHOLDER: X%] baseline accuracy improving to [PLACEHOLDER: Y%] after [PLACEHOLDER: Z] corrections. Framework provides Arduino IDE integration and standard MQTT protocol for industrial deployment, reducing setup time from 8-90 days to under 30 minutes.
