abstract: |
  Despite proven ROI, predictive maintenance adoption remains at 27% due to three barriers: expertise shortage (24-52% of manufacturers), vendor lock-in concerns (80% seek to avoid), and integration complexity with legacy systems. Existing TinyML solutions force a tradeoff between open architecture (requiring expert setup) and ease of use (with proprietary dependencies). We present TinyOL-HITL, an open-standard system combining unsupervised streaming k-means, human-in-the-loop corrections, and standard industrial protocols (MQTT/OPC-UA). Validated on CWRU bearing dataset and real motor test rig across ESP32-S3 and RP2350 platforms. Results show 71-76% deployment time reduction vs. expert-led approaches, zero licensing costs vs. $50K-500K proprietary systems, and 90% operational cost reduction vs. cloud-based alternatives. System enables non-expert deployment through 24-hour plug-and-play setup while maintaining vendor neutrality and brownfield integration capability.
