## Mermaid Diagrams Used

1. Pie chart (problem breakdown)
2. Flowchart (unsupervised rationale)
3. Flowchart (research setup)
4. Flowchart (base model)
5. Sequence diagram (SCADA integration)
6. Timeline (roadmap)
7. XY chart (accuracy placeholder)

## Speaker Notes

Speaker notes are in HTML comments below each slide:
