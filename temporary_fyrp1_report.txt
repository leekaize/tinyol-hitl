Abstract
This progress report details the development of an edge-based energy and condition monitoring
system for industrial machinery, leveraging the capabilities of Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML). The
primary objective is to create an easy to implement and adaptable predictive maintenance (PdM)
system targeting to bring value for small and medium enterprises (SMEs).
The research involved setting up an ESP32-based microcontroller unit (MCU) connected to various
sensors to collect and preprocess data from machinery. Literature review was done, and a full-
fledged  framework  is  proposed  to  tackle  research  problems.  Current  progress  demonstrates
successful data acquisition and preprocessing, with the ESP32 effectively interfacing with a GY-521
accelerometer and performing Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for frequency analysis. Data was then
transmitted to an InfluxDB cloud database for storage and further analysis.
The  project  implements  a  series  of  machine  learning  models:  an  autoencoder  for  dimensional
reduction,  an  Isolation  Forest  for  anomaly  detection,  and  K-Means  clustering  for  multi-class
classification.
Future work includes developing the software pipelines, refining these models for better accuracy,
and conducting extensive field trials to validate the system's performance in real-world industrial
environments.

Chapter 1:  Introduction
1.1 Background
Industry  4.0  focuses  on  improving  factory  processes  through  Cyber-Physical  Systems  (CPS),
Industrial  Internet  of  Things  (IIoT),  Artificial  Intelligence  (AI),  and  Cloud  Computing.  Machines
equipped  with  sensors  are  interconnected  via  local  or  cloud  networks,  forming  the  IIoT.  These
networks leverage AI to make decisions and utilize robotic systems to execute complex tasks. Cloud
computing  is  often  used  for  storage  and  communication.  This  integration  of  automation,
communication, and monitoring leads to more efficient industrial processes [1
].

Figure 1: Example of Traditional Industry 4.0 Setup.
Industry 4.0 significantly benefits from Predictive Maintenance (PdM), which uses AI to analyse
machine data and detect anomalies or faulty patterns [2]. Cost-benefit analyses have shown that
advanced  diagnostics  and  prognostics  can  lead  to  substantial  savings  by  preventing  unplanned
downtime and extending machinery life [3].
PdM often relies heavily on central servers for data processing and machine learning, increasing
latency and posing challenges in terms of network bandwidth, data management, and real-time
responsiveness.  Different  paradigms  have  been  proposed  to  address  the  issues  of  cloud-based
predictive maintenance [4
].
Microcontroller Units (MCUs) are typically deployed to communicate machine sensor data to the
cloud. Since data communication is a minimal task for current MCUs, their extra computing power
can be utilized for other functions. The emergence of Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML), deployed on
MCUs, brings intelligence directly to the machinery, enabling real-time decision-making with lower
bandwidth  requirements  (as  seen  in  Figure  2).  TinyML  allows  large  neural  networks  to  be
compressed into small yet accurate models suitable for running on MCUs [5
].

Despite the advancements, limitations and research gaps remain in applying TinyML in industrial
settings. This research focuses on ease-of-implementation and adaptability aspects. Some studies
have applied unsupervised learning models, which allow for easy implementation without requiring
machine failure data (often impossible to acquire) for training the model [6, 7
]. Other studies have
applied  incremental/online  learning  models  to  achieve  adaptable  systems  that  maintain  good
prediction accuracy as machine data drifts over time [7, 8].
This research aims to achieve a streamlined architecture with state-of-the-art TinyML workflows
for an unsupervised and adaptable condition monitoring system. A knowledge-based expert system
will be developed as a web application for users to extract insights. Such systems enable lower
technical personnel to fully utilize and maintain functionality, overcoming financial constraints, lack
of technical expertise, and resistance to change among employees, which are common barriers to
Industry 4.0 adoption [1
].

Edge-based Condition Monitoring Systems?
2.  How  can  incremental  learning  be  effectively  applied  to  enhance  the  adaptability  and
sustainability of Edge-based Condition Monitoring Systems?
3.  How can the edge-based condition monitoring results be processed and presented through
a Knowledge-Based Expert System to effectively extract business or operational insights?

1.4 Problem Statements
Traditional  cloud-based  predictive  maintenance  systems  face  several  limitations,  which  this
research aims to address by implementing TinyML with unsupervised and incremental learning on
edge devices:
•  Cost, Latency, and Real-Time Processing Limitations: Relying on central servers introduces
significant latency, higher costs due to network bandwidth and cloud servers, complex data
management, and delayed responsiveness.
•  Challenges  in  Implementation:  Predictive  maintenance  models  often  require  extensive
data infrastructure, which is challenging for SMEs lacking technical expertise and financial
resources. Supervised learning models require failure data, which is often unavailable.
•  Limited Adaptability to Changing Conditions: Existing PdM systems struggle to maintain
accuracy as machine conditions evolve. The lack of incremental learning capabilities means
they cannot adapt to new data, leading to suboptimal maintenance decisions and increased
operational risks.
•  Difficulty  in  Bringing  Business  Value:  Many  predictive  maintenance  systems  fail  to
translate machine learning output into actionable business or operational insights. This gap
hinders organizations to realise the full potential of these systems.

platform and Knowledge-Based Expert System, can effectively communicate maintenance
insights and demonstrate clear business value to SMEs, leading to improved operational
decision-making and reduced maintenance costs.

Chapter 2:  Literature Review
2.1 Industry 4.0
Khin and Kee [1] suggest that that Industry 4.0 adoption mainly affected by three factors:
•  Driving Factors: Companies are motivated by the need to streamline operations, stay ahead in
a  competitive  market,  and  address  both  labour  shortages  and  changing  customer
expectations.  This  shows  why  these  cutting-edge  technologies  matter  for  improving  how
things is made and following the trend.
•  Facilitating Factors: Making that Industry 4.0 leap means having the right mix of resources
(technologies  and  skilled  workers),  a  company  culture  that's  open  to  change,  and  some
government  support.  This  support  system  is  vital  for  giving  companies  the  framework  for
innovation.
•  Impeding Factors: Barriers like tight budgets, not having in-house tech experts, and employees
who  may  need  convincing  hold  some  companies  back.  To  overcome  this,  businesses  need
careful plans, maybe some training programs, and ways to manage the transition smoothly for
everyone involved.
Companies  are  best  positioned  to  adopt  Industry  4.0  when  they  understand  these  strong
motivators, have the necessary resources, and can tackle any roadblocks. This helps them strategize
and make this whole Industry 4.0 transition a success. Maturity model is often a good first step to
embark the transformation journey.
It's worth noting that standard Industry 4.0 maturity models sometimes start at "level 1", which can
be misleading for a lot of small and medium-sized businesses, as it doesn't reflect how far along,
they are with digital tools and smart manufacturing. Mittal, et al. [9]
 suggest including a "level 0"
as a more realistic starting point for these companies. Similarly, the maturity model proposed by
Santos and Martinho [10] is designed to assess a company's level of implementation of Industry 4.0
technologies  across  five  dimensions:  organizational  strategy,  structure,  and  culture;  workforce;
smart factories; smart processes; smart products and services. It utilizes 41 variables to measure
maturity and provides a roadmap for companies to progress in their Industry 4.0 journey. Each
dimension  is  evaluated  in  6  levels  of  maturity  (Level  0  to  5)  which  the  Level  0  to  4  are  the
incremental steps to achieve state-of-the-art Level 5.


11
2.1.1 Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)
In conjunction of Industry 4.0, according to Shah, et al. [11], developed countries have already
adopted IIoT technologies, bringing improvement on efficiency, productivity and decision-making.
Meanwhile, manufacturing and production SMEs in developing countries still having a hard time to
adopt. The study identified 47 factors influencing IIoT adoption, categorized under Technological,
Organisational, Environmental, and Individual (TOEI) factors.
Discussed  in  [12],  the  IIoT  architecture  is  a  complex  network  infrastructure  including  sensors,
gateways, and data processing units, which work together to collect, transmit, and analyse data.
The architecture can be split into four layers:
•  Perception  Layer,  composed  of  sensors  and  devices  that  collect  data  from  the  physical
environment.
•  Network Layer, responsible for data transmission, connecting the perception layer with higher
levels through various communication protocols.
•  Processing  Layer,  manages  data  processing,  storage,  and  analysis,  turning  raw  data  into
actionable insights.
•  Application Layer, where IIoT applications interface with users, delivering smart solutions and
controls for manufacturing processes.
The same layers of IIoT architecture applies to different smart industries including Transportation
and Logistics, Healthcare, Energy Consumption Monitoring, and Smart Factory.

2.1.2 Predictive Maintenance (PdM)
Challenges  in  implementing  PdM,  as  discussed  by  Achouch,  et  al.  [13],  include  financial  and
organizational constraints, data management complexities, and the technical challenges associated
with machine repair activities and model deployment.
Many PdM models can be offered depending on the digital maturity level, three main models are
discussed in [2] and [13]:
•  Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM): Monitors real-time equipment data, like vibration and
temperature,  to  schedule  maintenance  only  when  needed,  aiming  to  prevent  unnecessary
work and reduce downtime.
•  Prognostics  and  Health  Management  (PHM):  Goes beyond  CBM  by  forecasting  the  future
reliability  of  components,  integrating  continuous  monitoring  with  data  analysis  to  pre-
emptively address potential failures.

12
•  Remaining Useful Life (RUL): Estimates the time a component can reliably function before it
requires  repair  or  replacement,  facilitating  optimized  maintenance  planning  and  resource
allocation.

2.1.3 Condition Monitoring
According to Moiz, et al. [14], around 90% of industrial processes are dependent on Induction motor
due to the robust and economical nature of it. Failure of induction motors must be diagnosed on
time  to  prevent  unexpected  downtime  and  revenue  loss.  The main  reasons  of  medium-voltage
induction motor failure include stator faults (like winding openings or short circuits), rotor cage
failures (such as broken rotor bars or end-rings), air-gap irregularities, and bearing and gearbox
failures. Thermal overload, high electrical and mechanical stresses, and environmental factors like
high ambient temperature and moisture significantly contribute to these failures [
15].
The  techniques  of  Current  Signature  Analysis  (CSA)  and  Vibration  Signature  Analysis  (VSA)  are
normally  employed  for  induction  motor  predictive  maintenance.  CSA  uses  spectral  analysis,
specifically  Fast  Fourier  Transform  (FFT),  to  examine  stator  currents  and  identify  unique  fault
harmonics indicative of mechanical issues like bearing faults. VSA, on the other hand, applies FFT
to the frequency spectrum of motor housing vibrations to detect mechanical faults, such as bearing
damages and unbalanced loads [14
].
The motor faults can be classified into five groups which shows the likelihood of specific fault type.
The  groupings  are  decided  by  motor’s  shaft  speed  dominant  peaks  or  sideband  frequencies  in
frequency spectrum, grouped as Synchronous, Harmonic, Sub-synchronous, Non-synchronous and
Modulation group [16
].

2.1.4 Perception Devices
Vibration  Signature  Analysis  can  be  done  with  a  range  of  different  sensors  such  as  ADXL355
Accelerometer  [16],  GY521  Accelerometer-Gyroscope  Sensor  [17],  LM6DSOX  Movement  Sensor
with accelerometer, magnetometer, and a gyro [18], IIS3DWB Vibrometer [19]. To get an in-depth
condition monitoring, researchers often add in other sensors [17-19]:
•  MEMS microphones to pick up sound patterns and unusual noise levels.
•  Hall effect sensors to spot changes in the electromagnetic fields around electric motors.
•  Humidity  sensors  to  keep  tabs  on  moisture  levels,  and  temperature  sensors  to  detect
equipment overheating.

13
As for the core vibration sensors, two main types are: Capacitive Microelectromechanical System
(MEMS) accelerometers and piezoelectric accelerometers. MEMS accelerometers are known for
grabbing data from multiple axes at once while keeping power use low [16
]. The ADXL family of
MEMS accelerometers strikes a nice balance between how well it handles noise, its bandwidth, and
its g-range – this balance makes them a solid fit for lots of Condition-based Monitoring needs [20].

2.1.5 Communication and Network Layer
As  discussed  in  [21],  the  three  common  data  acquisition  serial  communication  protocols  have
distinct characteristics:
•  UART  (Universal  Asynchronous  Receiver/Transmitter):  Asynchronous  communication
method that doesn't require a shared clock between devices, using start and stop bits to frame
data  packets.  Ideal  for  low-cost,  minimal  wiring  setups  where  timing  variances  are
manageable.
•  SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface): Synchronous communication with a shared clock, enabling
higher data rates. Utilizes a master-slave setup with separate lines for data send and receive,
suitable for short-distance, high-speed data transfer. This is the chosen interface for [16
] due
to the faster communication compared to I2C bus.
•  I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit): This protocol needs just two wires and lets multiple devices chat
with each other. It's half-duplex (one way at a time) and works like a shared phone line – good
for connecting a bunch of devices in a small area.
As  discussed  in  [22
],  a  few  OT  Network  Protocols  can  be  used  for  direct  communication  with
industrial devices and include protocols such as: Modbus, OPC UA (Open Platform Communications
Unified Architecture), BACnet (Building Automation and Control Networks) and S7. Simpler sensor-
to-gateway data transmission normally utilise BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy). [
16, 18, 19]
IT  Network  Protocols,  used  for  higher-level  data  communication  and  management  in  the  IIoT
framework are also discussed in [22], including:
•  MQTT  (Message  Queuing  Telemetry  Transport):  The  default  choice  for  recent  projects,
including [16] and [18]. It's designed for lightweight machine-to-machine (IoT) communication,
with a simple 'publish/subscribe' messaging.
•  Ethernet, a family of networking technologies used in local area networks (LANs).
•  Wi-Fi, a technology for wireless local area networking with devices based on the IEEE 802.11
standards.

14
•  NB-IoT  (Narrowband  IoT),  a  standards-based  low  power  wide  area  (LPWA)  technology
developed to enable a wide range of new IoT devices and services.

2.1.6 Processing and Application Layer
Processing Layer handles data analysis, storage, and decision-making processes. It's where machine
learning  algorithms  can  be  applied  to  interpret  and  act  on  the  data  collected  by  sensors.  The
Application  Layer  then  uses  this  processed  data  to  drive  IIoT  applications,  facilitating  user
interaction and decision-making. It translates the insights gained from machine learning algorithms
into actionable information, enabling predictive maintenance, optimization, and enhanced control
over industrial processes [12
].
The traditional predictive maintenance often requires expert analysis on the monitored data to
identify conditions [16-19]. Machine learning has been the recent focus of research for feature
extraction enabling more efficient fault diagnostic [23].

2.2 Summary of Literature Review on IR4.0, PdM and CM
Industry 4.0 Considerations

Figure 3: Main Considerations for Industry 4.0 Implementation.
For industrial implementation, maturity models will be used to assess the company Industry 4.0
readiness  [9,  10],  then  an  implementation  plan  will  be  developed  accordingly.  The  driving,
facilitating  and  impeding  factors  will  be  considered  for  a  successful  implementation  [1].  This
research  will  tackle  a  few  impeding  factors  by  providing  system  with  low  technical  expertise
requirement and simple implementation.
Predictive Maintenance and Condition Monitoring
Condition-Based  Maintenance  through  Condition  Monitoring  are  well  established  for  Industrial
Induction Motor [14-16]. The vibration and current signature can be analysed in both time and
frequency domain. The known characteristics knowledge can be used to create the Knowledge-
Based Expert System, providing insights into Machine Learning output.
Layers within Industrial IoT Architecture

Figure 4: Four Layers of IIoT Architecture.
This  research  will  develop  a  streamlined  architecture  that  covers  all  the  4  layers  where  an
implementation guide will be given for companies to follow [12].
Perception Device: MEMS type accelerometers are ideal for low power consumption usage [16-19].
The exact model chosen will be based on price and accuracy requirements of the project.
Network and Communication: UART, SPI and I2C are all reliable OT Communication protocol for
MCUs [21]. Industrial OT Protocols such as Modbus and OPC-UA can be connected to MCU through
a  converter  [16,  18,  19].  IT  Network  Protocol  such  as  MQTT  will  be  utilised  for  lightweight
communication [16] [18].
Processing  and  Application:  Machine  Learning  can  be  applied  to  analyse  machine  conditions
(feature  extraction)  automatically  [23].  The  insights  can  go  through  a  Knowledge-Based  Expert
System and shown through a web application.

2.3 Machine Learning
Machine  learning  in  predictive  maintenance  (PdM)  leverages  a  blend  of  supervised  and
unsupervised techniques to predict and prevent equipment failures before they result in significant
downtime.  Carvalho,  et  al.  [24]  outlines  how  various  machine  learning  approaches,  including
statistical models, artificial intelligence, and model-based strategies, contribute to effective PdM.
While  supervised  learning  utilizes  labelled  data  to  predict  equipment  failures,  unsupervised
learning explores data to identify unseen patterns, offering insights where explicit labels are absent.

2.3.1 Supervised Learning
For  supervised  learning,  machine  learning  models  are  trained  on  a  labelled  dataset  to  make
predictions or classifications based on previous data.
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and k-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN): Susto, et al. [25] presents a
predictive  maintenance  (PdM)  model  utilising  a  combination  of  machine  learning  classifiers  to
handle predictive tasks in high-dimensional settings typical of semiconductor manufacturing. The
methodology  utilises  multiple  classifiers  to  manage  the  maintenance  schedules  effectively  by
considering different classification problems for failure prediction.
Decision Trees and Random Forests: Paolanti, et al. [26] discuss the implementation of a predictive
maintenance  system  based  on  a  Random  Forest  classifier.  This  Machine  Learning  model  is
employed  to  analyse  data  collected  from  various  sensors,  machine  PLCs,  and  communication
protocols, processed and managed through the Azure Cloud architecture.
Neural Networks: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs),
including Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), are common choices for modelling temporal
dynamics in predictive maintenance tasks. Berghout, et al. [27] utilise a deep learning model based
on Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) with local receptive fields for predictive maintenance. This
model excels in handling dynamic and complex data structures typical of naval propulsion systems,
offering  robust  feature  extraction  and  fault  diagnosis  capabilities.  The  approach  leverages
supervised  learning  to  fine-tune  the  deep  belief  networks  (DBN)  after  an  initial  unsupervised
training phase, enhancing the accuracy and generalization of maintenance predictions.
Regression Techniques: Linear Regression is utilized for its simplicity and effectiveness in modelling
the linear relationships between independent variables and the dependent variable (the condition
or performance of transport systems). This approach is particularly beneficial for scenarios where

17
the relationships are well-defined and not overly complex, offering a straightforward interpretation
and efficient computation. [28
]

2.3.2 Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning techniques are employed in predictive maintenance to analyse data without
labelled class. These methods are particularly useful for discovering hidden patterns or intrinsic
structures within maintenance data.
Clustering:  Amruthnath  and  Gupta  [29]
  focus  on  clustering  methods  like  PCA  T2  statistic,
Hierarchical clustering, K-Means, Fuzzy C-Means clustering, and model-based clustering to analyse
vibration  data  collected  from  an  exhaust  fan.  They  propose  a  methodology  to  select  the  best-
performing  model  based  on  the  results,  thus  providing  a  structured  approach  to  implement
unsupervised machine learning in predictive maintenance tasks.
Principal  Component  Analysis  (PCA):  Sarita,  et  al.  [30]  emphasize  the  application  of  PCA,  this
method is particularly effective for early fault detection in equipment like industrial induced draft
(ID) fans, where high vibration levels can lead to failures. By transforming the data into a set of
orthogonal principal components, PCA effectively reduces dimensionality while preserving most of
the variance, thereby enhancing the interpretability and efficiency of the fault detection process.
Autoencoder: A type of unsupervised neural networks, designed to learn data patterns and can
pinpoint anything out of the ordinary. Simi and Resmi [31] utilise autoencoders to detect anomalies
by learning the normal operational patterns and identifying deviations. Ali, et al. [32] employ an
LSTM  autoencoder  to  manage  time-series  data,  capturing  temporal  dependencies  within  the
operational  data  of  rotational  machinery  for  better  fault  prediction  and  RUL  estimation.
Additionally,  Jakubowski,  et  al.  [33]  implement  a  Variational  Autoencoder  (VAE)  that  enhances
anomaly detection by generating a probabilistic representation of input data, allowing for more
nuanced understanding of asset condition changes.
Isolation  Forest  (IF):  Operates  by  isolating  anomalies  instead  of  profiling  normal  data  points,
effectively  identifying  discrepancies  in  data.  Martin-del-Campo  and  Al-Kahwati  [34]  integrate
sparse  coding  with  dictionary  learning  and  Isolation  Forest  to  produce  an  anomaly  score  for
predictive maintenance. Mousavi and Gandomi [35] apply the Variational Mode Decomposition
(VMD)  algorithm  to  preprocess  frequency  signals,  enhancing  the  success  of  Isolation  Forest  in
monitoring. It is shown that high accuracies for predictive maintenance can be achieved without
labelled fault data. [
36, 37]


18
2.3.3 Incremental Learning
Incremental  Learning  (IL)  is  crucial  in  predictive  maintenance  (PdM)  for  handling  changing
environments  where  data  distributions  slowly  evolve  over  long  time.  IL  can  be  leveraged  to
continuously adapt predictive models to new data while retaining previously acquired knowledge,
mitigating the  issue  of  catastrophic  forgetting. This  is  particularly vital  in  industrial  applications
where machine conditions can shift due to factors like wear and tear, operational adjustments, or
environmental changes. IL employs techniques that update the learning models incrementally as
new data becomes available, ensuring the models remain effective over time despite changes in
data characteristics [38
].
Incremental Feature Learning (IFL) is an advanced methodology that dynamically incorporates new
features  into  a  predictive  model  without  retraining  from  scratch.  The  algorithm  developed  by
Sadreddin and Sadaoui [39]
 employs constructive neural networks to optimise network topology
gradually  as  new  feature  groups  are  added.  This  approach  ensures  that  the  model  adapts  to
changing data distributions effectively, enhancing predictive accuracy over time. The IFL algorithm
constructs the neural network incrementally by adding new hidden units and connections for each
new feature group.
While incremental and continual learning offer significant advantages for adaptive maintenance
systems, they also present challenges such as catastrophic forgetting, where the model loses the
ability to recall previously learned information as it learns new patterns.
1.  Mitigation  Strategies:  Various  strategies,  including  architectural  modifications,  memory
systems, and optimization techniques, have been proposed to address catastrophic forgetting.
For  example,  dual  memory  models  and  regularization  methods  help  preserve  critical
knowledge while allowing the model to learn new information [39, 40
].
2.  Future Directions: Research continues to explore more efficient algorithms and frameworks
that  can  balance  the  need  for  adaptation  with  the  constraints  of  edge  computing
environments. Integrating these approaches with advanced data preprocessing and feature
selection techniques can further enhance their effectiveness [39, 40
].

2.3.4 Knowledge-Based Expert System
The  integration  of  Knowledge-Based  Expert  Systems  (KBES)  into  predictive  maintenance
frameworks  leverage  domain-specific  expertise  to  diagnose  machine  conditions,  recommend
maintenance  actions,  and  manage  maintenance  schedules,  thereby  reducing  downtime  and
maintenance costs.

19
The EXPERT-MM system [41
], is an established KBES designed to manage maintenance activities by
leveraging  different  types  of  knowledge:  declarative,  procedural,  and  heuristic.  The  system
architecture  integrates  a  database,  algorithms  and  models  base,  expert  system  module,  user
interface, and a control program (processor). This system supports three main functions:
1.  Maintenance Policy Suggestions: EXPERT-MM analyses historical failure data to recommend
optimal  preventive  maintenance  intervals  using  a  rule-based  representation  scheme  and
backward chaining inference strategy.
2.  Machine  Diagnosis:  The  system  diagnoses  faults  in  machinery,  such  as  rotary  screw  air
compressors, by structuring knowledge into decision tree diagrams and converting them into
IF-THEN rules. This process facilitates the identification and localization of faults.
3.  Maintenance  Scheduling:  The  system  generates  maintenance  schedules  based  on  optimal
inspection intervals, ensuring timely preventive actions.

Figure 5: Expert-MM Architecture. (Extracted from Batanov, et al. [41])
A modern approach to KBES involves transforming Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM) models
into  Complex  Event  Processing  (CEP)  rules  to  handle  large  volumes  of  real-time  data.  This
transformation process, grounded in Model-Driven Architecture (MDA), involves converting CBM
knowledge into generic rules and subsequently into Event Processing Language (EPL) rules [42
].
The  refinement  of  rule  bases  in  KBES  [43]  is  crucial  for  maintaining  accuracy  and  relevance  in
predictive maintenance. This involves:
1.  Rule Quality Measures: These measures assess the effectiveness of rules in predicting and
diagnosing faults, guiding the refinement process.
2.  Implementation:  By  continuously  updating  and  refining  the  rule  base,  the  KBES  remains
adaptable to new data and evolving conditions.

2.4 Summary of Literature Review on ML for PdM

Figure 6: PdM System Combining Supervised, Unsupervised, Incremental Learning and KBES.
Supervised and Unsupervised Learning
Supervised Learning, training models on labelled data, primarily used for predictive tasks with high
accuracy,  such  as  failure  prediction  and  maintenance  schedule  optimization.  Techniques  like
Support  Vector  Machines  (SVMs),  k-Nearest  Neighbours  (k-NN)  [25],  Decision  Trees  [26],  and
Neural Networks (CNNs and RNNs) [27] are already well discovered to analyse historical data and
predict  equipment  failures,  optimize  maintenance  schedules,  and  model  temporal  dynamics  in
sensor data.
Unsupervised Machine Learning is used when the data lacks labels, focuses on identifying hidden
patterns or intrinsic structures within the data, making it suitable for anomaly detection and pattern
discovery.  Techniques  such  as  Clustering  (K-Means,  Fuzzy  C-Means)  [29],  Principal  Component
Analysis  (PCA)  [30],  Autoencoders  [31-33],  and  Isolation  Forests  [34-37]  are  used  to  analyse
unlabelled data to detect anomalies, reduce data dimensionality, and isolate discrepancies.
Incremental Learning
This  approach  gradually  incorporates  new  features  into  the  model,  enhancing  its  predictive
accuracy and adaptability to changing data distributions without retraining from scratch [38]. A
significant  challenge  in  incremental  learning  is  catastrophic  forgetting,  where  the  model  loses
previously acquired knowledge when new information is introduced [
39, 40].
Knowledge-Based Expert Systems (KBES)
Although existed for more than 30 years [41], with more advanced machine learning capabilities
and ML output from unsupervised models. Research on the system should be done to cater the
intricacies. Modern approach such as EPL and Rule Quality Measures are considered [42, 43].

2.5 TinyML
2.5.1 Core Principles
1.  Resource Efficiency: TinyML focuses on executing machine learning models on devices with
extremely limited computational resources under minimal energy consumption [5].
2.  On-Device Inference: New data processing approaches can be considered, as more data are
available without the complications to upload to cloud under high bandwidth [44].
3.  Privacy  and  Security:  TinyML  inherently  improves  data  privacy  and  security.  Since  data
remains on the device, it is less susceptible to breaches during transmission [44].
4.  Low Latency: TinyML reduces the latency involved in making real-time decisions because the
data does not need to be sent to a cloud server for processing [44].
5.  Scalability  and  Deployment:  TinyML  offers  scalability  for  deploying  machine  learning
capabilities across a wide array of devices and environments. This enables the proliferation of
intelligent IoT devices without the need for continuous cloud connectivity [44].

2.5.2 Technical Features
1.  Model  Compression  Techniques:  TinyML  leverages  various  model  compression  techniques
such  as  pruning,  quantization,  and  efficient  architectures  like  MobileNets.  These  methods
reduce  the  size  and  complexity  of  ML  models,  making  them  suitable  for  deployment  on
microcontrollers [5
].
2.  Energy  Efficiency:  A  critical  feature  of  TinyML  is  its  ability  to  operate  on  ultra-low  power
devices. The combination of efficient hardware and optimized models ensures that TinyML
applications can run on battery-powered devices for extended periods [44
].
3.  Hardware  and Software  Integration:  TinyML  frameworks  are  designed  to  work  seamlessly
with a variety of hardware platforms. TensorFlow Lite Micro (TFLM), for instance, is specifically
built for deep learning on microcontrollers with very limited memory, addressing hardware
diversity and resource constraints [44
].
4.  Development Ecosystem: The TinyML ecosystem includes a broad array of tools and libraries
that  facilitate  the  development,  training,  and  deployment  of  models.  Frameworks  like
TensorFlow Lite Micro integrate with existing ML tools, allowing for model training on more
powerful platforms before deployment on constrained devices [45
].

2.5.3 Unsupervised TinyML Applications
Below is a list of industrial related research using unsupervised TinyML models, but all consists of
some weakness and need further improvement to suit the desired industrial application.
Table 1: List of Unsupervised TinyML Algorithms Used on Existing Highly Related Research
Algorithm/Model  Hardware and Settings  Summary
Deep AE  General [46]  Emphasizing minimal memory
use and computational overhead.
TEDA  Arduino Nano 33 IoT – Vehicle [6]  Detect road surface anomalies
with accelerometer data.
DNN-Autoencoder  Arduino Nano 33 – Industrial [8]  Incorporating Online Learning

Variational AE  Arduino Nano – Household [47]  Detecting mechanical anomalies
of washing machine. Paying
significant attention to battery
life implications.
With these previous works on Unsupervised Learning through TinyML, a solid foundation is formed
for an efficient TinyML application that could incorporate Online Learning and applied in different
settings.

2.5.4 TinyML Incremental and Online Learning
As discussed in the general Machine Learning for Predictive Maintenance, incremental learning
techniques is often implemented. It has also been successfully integrated in TinyML applications
where systems are adaptable in dynamic environments. Pavan, et al. [48] has created the “TyBox”
toolbox for automating the design and deployment of TinyML models that support incremental
learning.  Chowdhary  and  Saha  [49]  achieved  an  online  learning  algorithm  that  works  under
extremely minimal memory usage (Below 8KB).

2.5.5 Supported Hardware
Informed by the comprehensive comparison in Capogrosso, et al. [50], this research will exclusively
focus  on  CPU-based  MCUs.  Alternative  architectures  present  drawbacks  that  conflict  with  the
project's goals, where GPUs has overly expensive cost, FPGAs still have development complexity

23
and  limited  libraries  impede  rapid  prototyping  and  TPUs  having  specialized  nature  but  lack  of
developer resources.
CPU-based MCUs align with the project's emphasis on cost-effectiveness and accessibility due to
their widespread off-the-shelf availability. The most popular off-the-shelf MCUs according to [50]
are listed below.
Table 2: Popular Off-The-Shelf MCUs.
Device  CPU  Clock  SRAM
Arduino Nano 33 BLE  ARM Cortex M4  64 MHz  256 KB
STM32 Family  ARM Cortex M  32 - 550 MHz  2 – 564 KB
ESP32-based  Xtensa LX6  240 MHz  520 KB
Raspberry Pi Pico  ARM Cortex M  133 MHz  264 KB
•  Arduino Nano 33 BLE is suitable for rapid prototyping with wide range of functionalities,
but it offers a lower price-to-performance ratio.
•  STM32  Family  has  versatile  range  spans  ultra-low  power  to  high-performance  devices,
including wireless variants.
•  ESP32-based MCUs offer the computational capacity necessary for experimentation and
convenience of built-in Wi-Fi while maintaining a favourable price-to-performance ratio.
•  Raspberry Pi Pico is a budget-friendly option having slightly weaker computing power.

2.5.6 Deployment Framework/Software
There  are  only  two  commonly  used  deployment  frameworks  currently:  TensorFlow  Lite  Micro
(TFLM)  and  Edge  Impulse.  The  choice  between  these  frameworks  depends  on  factors  such  as
flexibility,  documentation,  user  support,  and  the  specific  requirements  of  the  deployment
environment.
TensorFlow Lite Micro (TFLM):
•  Advantages: TFLM is engineered specifically to address the challenges of embedded machine
learning, providing a low memory footprint and minimal runtime overhead, crucial for devices
with  limited  computational  resources.  It  employs  an  interpreter-based  approach  which,
contrary to traditional views, offers high performance for TinyML applications by minimizing
runtime overhead and maximizing flexibility in deployment scenarios [45
].
•  Challenges:  While  highly  efficient,  TFLM's  performance  can  still  be  constrained  by  the
computational limits of the target devices. The framework requires careful optimization to

24
maximize efficiency, which can be a barrier for developers without deep embedded systems
expertise [45
].

Edge Impulse:
•  Advantages:  Known  for  its  user-friendly  graphical  interface,  Edge  Impulse  accelerates  the
prototyping and experimental phases of development. It provides integrated tools for data
collection  and  signal  processing,  streamlining  the  overall  development  process  for  TinyML
applications [5
].
•  Challenges: This framework offers limited opportunities for custom algorithm development
and might foster dependence on the platform for essential model updates, which can be a
drawback for developing bespoke solutions [5].

2.5.7 Over-the-air (OTA) Update
Over-the-Air (OTA) Update allows IoT devices to improve over time after they are deployed in the
field. They allow for fixes, improvements, and important security patches to be sent wirelessly. In
the context of TinyML, OTA updates enable future improvement on the edge devices functionalities
without the need for physical interaction, which is especially valuable in large-scale or inaccessible
deployments.
The  OTA-TinyML  framework  proposed  by  Sudharsan,  et  al.  [51]  addresses  these  challenges  by
enabling the efficient deployment of TinyML models to a wide array of IoT devices. This framework
allows devices to fetch and store new models from a cloud server over a secure HTTPS connection,
and then execute these models locally. This capability not only enhances the functionality of IoT
devices but also ensures that they can adapt to new data or operational requirements over time
without manual updates.

2.5.8 Tiny-MLOps
According to Tamburri [52], Machine-Learning Operations (MLOps) paradigm is one of the growing
trends. It involves orchestrating various software components for data ingestion, transformation,
continuous  ML  training/deployment,  and  output  production  as  part  of  an  AI  software  system.
Sustainability  acts  as  an  overarching  property  that  ties  together  and  enables  the  continuous
assurance of explainability, fairness, and accountability in MLOps over the long-term.

25

Figure 7: Sustainable MLOps Paradigm Proposed by Tamburri [52].
Standard MLOps practices are designed for cloud/edge devices with strong computing resources
running Linux. However, extending MLOps to tiny IoT devices with limited memory/compute poses
challenges.  To  achieve  the  system  sustainability  on  TinyML,  a  similar  paradigm  is  proposed  by
Antonini, et al. [53]
, as Tiny-MLOps. It adapts each phase of the classical MLOps loop (Plan, Create,
Verify, Package, Release, Configure, Monitor) to fit the resource constraints of far edge IoT devices.

Figure 8: Tiny-MLOps Paradigm Proposed by Antonini, et al. [53].

2.6 Summary of Literature Review on TinyML for PdM

Figure 9: Main Factors of Implementing TinyML on PdM.
Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) is an emerging field that integrates machine learning capabilities
into edge devices, most commonly microcontroller units (MCUs) to enable real-time, on-device
data processing for predictive maintenance (PdM). It shifts some cloud computing workload to the
edge device which reduces network bandwidth and cloud storage requirements. One single edge
device can now take care of most tasks in network and processing layer.
Establish TinyML Applications in PdM
1.  Unsupervised Learning: TinyML models for anomaly detection and clustering (e.g., Isolation
Forests [7], Autoencoders [8, 46, 47]) are employed to identify unusual patterns in machinery
data without requiring labelled datasets.
2.  System Architecture: TinyML system frameworks and architecture, such as TinyML-Ops [53
]
and OTA-TinyML [51] allows the edge device to be systematically managed remotely.
3.  Incremental Learning: Allowing models to adapt to new data over time, which is crucial for
maintaining accuracy as machine conditions change. It can be well achieved with a structured
system architecture above [48, 49
].
4.  Deployment  Frameworks:  Tools  like  TFLM  [45]  and  Edge  Impulse  [5]  facilitate  the
development and deployment of TinyML models, providing a comprehensive ecosystem for
building and managing TinyML applications.
CPU-based MCUs will be the research focus as it achieve a balance between robustness and support
from current TinyML frameworks [50]. The exact hardware model will be selected based on price,
performance and ease of use.
While TinyML presents numerous benefits, challenges such as model accuracy and the integration
of  machine  learning  algorithms  (e.g.,  K-means  clustering  needs  custom  implementation  on  the
MCUs)  need  to  be  addressed.  Future  research  will  likely  focus  on  enhancing  model  efficiency,
developing  more  robust  frameworks,  and ensuring  seamless  integration  with  existing  industrial
systems.

software  development.  It  integrates  seamlessly  with  Visual  Studio  Code,  providing  a  robust
environment  for  ESP32  programming.  Its  robust  library  management  system,  debugging

32
3.2 Data Acquisition and Processing
The  goal  is  to  ensure  accurate  and  reliable  data  collection  from  sensors,  followed  by  effective
preprocessing to prepare the data for machine learning models.
3.2.1 Sensor Data Acquisition

effective training of machine learning models.

33
3.3 Machine Learning and Knowledge-based Expert System
This section shows the implementation of ML models and the development of a Knowledge-Based
Expert System (KBES) to provide actionable insights and enhance decision-making processes.
3.3.1 Unsupervised Learning
Initial models will be based on clustering and anomaly detection algorithms that do not require
labelled data. These models will identify unusual patterns that may indicate machinery faults.
The three reliable methods as described in Literature Review will all be implemented and evaluated.
They  can  be  combined  into  single  TinyML  application  which  each  will  have  different  use.  The
Clustering is important for Multi-class Classification of the motor operation patterns, where the
Autoencoder  and  Isolation  Forest  are  useful  for  dimensional  reduction,  feature  extraction  and
anomaly detection.

Figure 14: Tentative Unsupervised Learning Workflow.

Autoencoder for Dimensional Reduction: Autoencoders are used to reduce the dimensionality of
the sensor data, preserving essential features while eliminating noise and redundancy.
Implementation Steps:
1.  Model Training (TensorFlow): Collect a dataset of normal operational data from sensors. Train
an autoencoder on this dataset, which consists of an encoder that compresses the input data
into a lower-dimensional space and a decoder that reconstructs the data from this compressed
representation.
2.  Model  Conversion:  Convert  the  trained  autoencoder  model  to  TensorFlow  Lite  format  for
deployment on the ESP32.
3.  Model Deployment: Deploy the TensorFlow Lite model on the ESP32 using TensorFlow Lite
Micro (TFLM). Integrate the model with the data acquisition code to process incoming sensor
data and obtain the compressed representations.


34
Isolation Forest for Anomaly Detection: Isolation Forest is used to detect anomalies in the reduced-
dimensional data produced by the autoencoder. It isolates anomalies instead of profiling normal
data points.
Implementation Steps:

representations of normal operational data.
2.  Model Deployment: Use the trained Isolation Forest model to monitor incoming data in real-
time on the ESP32. Classify data points as normal or anomalous based on the Isolation Forest

detailed insights into the machine's operational patterns.


35
3.3.2 Incremental Learning
To accommodate changes in machinery behaviour over time, incremental learning models will be
developed. These models will update themselves as new data is collected, ensuring that the system
adapts to new conditions without manual intervention.
With  the  implementation  of  Tiny-MLOps  and  corresponding  settings  when  designing  the
Unsupervised Learning workflow, an incremental learning framework can be achieved. The details
will be designed after the unsupervised learning models are proven working.

data in Firebase for real-time inference as an expert system. Where operations suggestions
will be provided by analysing the historical and current data.
2.  Web Application: Develop a ReactJS web application to display data and insights. Implement
dashboards for real-time monitoring, anomaly alerts, and maintenance recommendations.

3.4 Project Implementation
3.4.1 Test Rig Development
A test rig will be setup that simulates real-world industrial machinery operations, serving as the
initial testing ground for the predictive maintenance system. It is important to develop each stage
of  the  whole  architecture  through  a  non-production  setup  and  benchmark  feasibility  of  the
proposed architecture.
As the research focus is on the development of software architecture and TinyML models, therefore
the  test  rig  can  use  a  consumer  type  accelerometer  to  obtain  real-time  data.  A  GY-521
accelerometer  will  be  used  and  attached  to  a standing  fan.  It  will  be  aimed  to  recognise  the  3
different moving speed of the fan, although not identical to industrial application, it is enough to
validate the feasibility of the system.

MQTT to the cloud.
2.  Data Preprocessing: Implement noise filtering using low-pass filters. Extract features such as
mean, standard deviation, and FFT components from the vibration data.
3.  Model Deployment: Deploy the Autoencoder model on the ESP32 to perform dimensionality
reduction. Use the reduced data as input to the Isolation Forest model for anomaly detection.
Further classify normal data using the K-Means clustering model to identify operational states.

3.4.2 Industrial Environment Testing
The purpose is to validate the system in a real-world industrial setting using standard industrial
sensors and power meters. Industrial standard Vibration Sensor and Power Meter will be used for
the industrial type of setup. Additionally, a PCB might be used to ensure reliable connection of the
final setup.
Following the common hardware used by industry partner, ifm VKV022 industrial vibration sensor
will be used for vibration data and a Schneider PM1000H Power Meter will be used for power

Implementation Steps:
1.  Sensor Data Acquisition: Acquire data from both sources onto ESP32.
2.  Data  Preprocessing:  Implement  real-time  noise  filtering,  feature  extraction  and  condition
recognition on the ESP32. Use MQTT to transmit pre-processed data to the cloud for further
analysis.
3.  Model  Deployment:  Deploy  and  test  the  integrated  Autoencoder,  Isolation  Forest,  and  K-
Means models in the industrial environment. Monitor the system’s performance in detecting
anomalies and classifying operational states.

3.5 Evaluation and Benchmarking
3.5.1 Performance Metrics
To  evaluate  the  performance  of  the  predictive  maintenance  system,  the  predicted  machine
condition  can  be  compared  with  expected  machine  condition  through  human  expertise  or
intentional setup. The following metrics will be used:
1.  Precision: This metric measures the accuracy of the positive predictions. It is the ratio of true
positive results to the total number of positive predictions made.
2.  Recall: This metric measures the ability of the model to identify all relevant instances. It is the
ratio of true positive results to the total number of actual positives.
3.  F1-Score:  This  is  the  harmonic mean of  precision  and  recall,  providing  a  single  metric  that
balances both concerns.
The system leaning towards precision or recall will be decided through real-world testing. Normally,
high precision is preferred over high recall in such system, as false negative can be annoying in a
Condition Monitoring system.

3.5.2 System Performance Evaluation
The  performance  of  the  predictive  maintenance  system  will  be  evaluated  in  a  controlled
environment of the test rig to test its accuracy and reliability:
1.  Controlled Testing: This metric measures the accuracy of the positive predictions. It is the ratio
of true positive results to the total number of positive predictions made.
2.  Data Collection: Continuously collect data from the sensors and evaluate the system's ability
to detect anomalies and classify operational states.
3.  Metric Calculation: Calculate precision, recall, F1-score, MAE, and MSE for the collected data
to quantify the system's performance.
4.  Iterative Improvement: Based on the results, refine the models and system architecture to
improve performance.


39
3.5.3 Benchmarking with Virtual Hardware Model
The TinyML neural network model can be analysed in SIMULINK (Deep Learning Toolbox) through
fault  data  generated  by  virtual  hardware model  (Simscape  Electrical). This  allows tuning  of  the
models without complication of generating fault in real world hardware.
The TinyML neural network model will be analysed in MATLAB's Simulink using the Deep Learning
Toolbox  through  fault  data  generated  by  a  virtual  hardware  model  (Simscape  Electrical).  This
approach  allows  tuning  of  the  models  without  the  complications  and  risks  associated  with
generating faults in real-world hardware. Key steps including:
1.  Data Generation: Use Simscape Electrical to simulate various fault conditions and generate
corresponding data.
2.  Model Analysis: Apply the generated data to the TinyML models to evaluate their performance
under different simulated conditions.
3.  Parameter  Tuning:  Adjust  the  model  parameters  to  optimize  performance  based  on  the
simulation results.
4.  Validation: Validate the tuned models using a separate set of simulated data to ensure they
generalize well to unseen conditions.
Similarly,  the  data  generated  can  also  be  exported  to  test  other  machine  learning  algorithms
performance outside Simulink, such as in Python for the Isolation Forest and K-Means Clustering.

3.5.4 Field Trials
After initial testing, the system will undergo field trials in an industrial setting to evaluate its real-
world effectiveness and adaptability:
1.  Deployment:  Install  the  system  on  industrial  machinery  and  integrate  it  with  existing
monitoring infrastructure.
2.  Live  Data  Collection:  Collect  live  data  over  an  extended  period  to  assess  the  system's
performance in a real-world environment.
3.  Performance Monitoring: Continuously monitor the system's performance and adjust models
as necessary to handle the real-world variability.
4.  Feedback Loop: Use the feedback from system operators to refine the system and improve
user interface and functionality.

3.5.5 User Feedback

Feedback from system operators will be collected to refine the user interface and functionality of
the system, ensuring it meets the practical needs of industry professionals:
1.  Surveys and Interviews: Conduct surveys and interviews with operators to gather detailed
feedback on system usability and performance.
2.  User  Interface  Adjustments:  Make  necessary  adjustments  to  the  web  application  and
dashboard based on the feedback.
3.  Functional Enhancements: Implement additional features or improve existing ones based on
user suggestions to enhance the system's utility and ease of use.

3.5.6 Future Improvements
Based on the evaluation and benchmarking results, future improvements will be planned, including:
1.  Scalability Testing: Ensure the system can handle larger datasets and more complex scenarios.
2.  Extended Field Trials: Conduct longer-term field trials to validate the system's reliability and
effectiveness over time.
3.  Advanced  Features:  Develop  and  integrate  advanced  features  such  as  real-time  alerts,
predictive maintenance scheduling, and detailed analytics.
